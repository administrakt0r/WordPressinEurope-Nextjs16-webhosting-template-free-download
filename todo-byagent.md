# TODOs (Generated by Steward 🧭)

## 🔥 High Priority (Bugs / Risks)
<!-- Things that could break, cause bugs, or lead to incidents -->

## ⚠️ Medium Priority (Tech Debt)
<!-- Design issues, cleanup, refactors that need thought -->
- [app/layout.tsx] The `BackToTop` component is imported but not rendered. It should be added to the layout to enable "scroll to top" functionality.

## ✨ Low Priority (Quality / Polish)
<!-- Readability, naming, structure, consistency -->
- [lib/links.ts] Consider using `as const` for `EXTERNAL_LINKS` object to improve type safety with literal types.

## ✅ Completed by Agent
<!-- [YYYY-MM-DD] [FILE] Description -->
- [2026-01-14] [components/ui/BackToTop.tsx] Added `requestAnimationFrame` throttling to scroll event listener to improve performance and prevent main-thread blocking.
- [2026-01-14] [components/sections/PricingCard.tsx] Fixed broken syntax (unclosed map), removed duplicate "Free Forever" badge, and wrapped in `React.memo` for optimization.
